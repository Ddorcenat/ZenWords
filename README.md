# ZenWords

## Overview

**Project Title**: ZenWord 

**Project Description**: This project is a simple web app that shows a random quote each time the user clicks a button. Users can also write their own thoughts in a journal section and save their notes. The entries are stored in the browser using localStorage and displayed on the page.

**Project Goals**: 
* Practice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together
* Use an API to fetch and display a random quote
* Let users type and save personal notes
* Store data locally in the browser

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download or clone the project files from GitHub
2. Make sure all files are in the same folder (HTML, CSS, JS)
3. Open index.html in your web browser

Instructions for using the software:

1. Wait for the quote to load
2. Click the "New Quote" button to see a different quote
3. Type your thoughts in the text box and click "Save Note"
4. Your notes will appear below and stay saved even if you close the tab
